## Why Responsive:

1.  Quiz 8
> press on (ctrl + Shift + M) -- toggle device toolbar. Then go the dropdown menu and then (Edit...). Then (Add Custom Device).

## Starting Small:

1. Defining the Viewport
> His chrome book is 2560pixel width. However when he open the viewport width he gets only 1280px. WHY ? becuase not all pixels are cerated equally ?!

2. Pixels, pixels and moar pixels!
> Hardware Pixels vs Device Independented Pixel -- DIP will always take same amount of display on the screen regardless of the pixel desity of the display. The 1280px DIPs scales up to 2560px HP. So you should always include the ViewPort Meta.

3. Pixelation
> mobile device pixels that found on the specs are the HP.

4. Calculating DPR
>With one dip for every two hardware pixels, the device pixel ratio is 2!

5. What's the difference?
> The viewport and the device pixel ratio are both likely causes for the differences between devices.
